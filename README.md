## Architecture

The codebase follows clean architecture principles. Domain logic is separated from UI and API concerns.

- **src/services/** ‚Äì API modules for GitHub queries (via `@octokit/rest`).
- **src/hooks/** ‚Äì Reusable hooks for fetching and formatting data.
- **src/contexts/AuthContext/** ‚Äì Provides authentication state.
- **src/contexts/ThemeModeContext/** ‚Äì Manages light/dark mode.
- **src/components/** ‚Äì UI components (tables, cards, charts, etc.).
- **src/pages/** ‚Äì Top-level pages for metrics, developer, and repository insights.
- **src/types/** ‚Äì TypeScript types and interfaces.
- **src/utils/** ‚Äì Utility functions and helpers.

## Getting Started

### Development

Install dependencies and start the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) and enter your GitHub personal access token.

### Testing

Run unit tests with coverage:

```bash
npm test
```

To update the coverage badge in the README after running tests:

```bash
node scripts/updateReadmeCoverage.js
```

### Linting

Check code quality with ESLint:

```bash
npm run lint
```

Format code with Prettier:

```bash
npm run format
```

### Production build

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The compiled files will be in the `build/` directory.
