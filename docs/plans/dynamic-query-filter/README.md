# Dynamic Query Filter Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan breaks down the Dynamic Query Filter feature into 6 incremental chunks that can be implemented without breaking current application behavior. Each chunk builds upon the previous one while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Implementation Strategy

The approach follows these principles:

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Current `/insights` route continues to work as before
2. **Feature Flags**: New functionality is additive and optional
3. **Incremental Enhancement**: Each chunk adds value while maintaining stability
4. **Testing First**: Each chunk includes comprehensive test coverage
5. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support throughout
6. **API Standards**: Use Octokit SDK for all GitHub API interactions
7. **UI Consistency**: Use HeroUI components for all user interface elements

## Implementation Chunks

### Chunk 1: URL Parameter Foundation

**File**: `01-url-parameter-foundation.md`
**Duration**: 3-4 days
**Dependencies**: None

Add URL parameter support to the insights page while maintaining current default behavior. Users can manually add query parameters to URLs, but the UI remains unchanged.

### Chunk 2: Enhanced API Service Layer

**File**: `02-enhanced-api-service-layer.md`
**Duration**: 3-4 days
**Dependencies**: Chunk 1

Refactor the API service layer to support dynamic queries while maintaining existing function signatures. Add new overloaded functions for enhanced capabilities.

### Chunk 3: Query Display Interface

**File**: `03-query-display-interface.md`
**Duration**: 2-3 days
**Dependencies**: Chunk 1, 2

Add a read-only query display component that shows the current active query. Users can see what data is being displayed but cannot edit it yet.

### Chunk 4: Basic Query Editor

**File**: `04-basic-query-editor.md`
**Duration**: 4-5 days
**Dependencies**: Chunk 1, 2, 3

Implement a basic query editor that allows users to modify the search query using a text input. Includes validation and error handling.

### Chunk 5: Visual Filter Builder

**File**: `05-visual-filter-builder.md`
**Duration**: 5-6 days
**Dependencies**: Chunk 1, 2, 3, 4

Add a user-friendly visual filter interface with form controls for common filters. Users can choose between visual and advanced text modes.

### Chunk 6: Autocomplete and Sharing

**File**: `06-autocomplete-and-sharing.md`
**Duration**: 4-5 days
**Dependencies**: All previous chunks

Implement autocomplete suggestions, query templates, and URL sharing functionality to complete the feature.

## Development Timeline

- **Total Duration**: 20-27 days (4-5.5 weeks)
- **Team Size**: 1 developer
- **Parallel Work**: Testing can be done in parallel with development
- **Buffer**: 20% buffer included for unexpected issues

## Testing Strategy

Each chunk includes:

- Unit tests for new components and services
- Integration tests for user workflows
- Visual regression tests for UI components
- E2E tests for critical user journeys

## Risk Management

- **API Rate Limiting**: Addressed in Chunk 2 with caching
- **URL Length Limits**: Handled in Chunk 1 with compression
- **User Experience**: Progressive enhancement approach
- **Performance**: Debouncing and optimization in each chunk

## Success Metrics

- No regression in existing functionality
- All new features work as specified
- Test coverage maintains >90%
- Performance metrics stay within acceptable bounds
- User feedback is positive during incremental rollouts

## Getting Started

1. Review each chunk's detailed plan
2. Set up feature branch: `feature/dynamic-query-filter`
3. Begin with Chunk 1: URL Parameter Foundation
4. Complete each chunk with full testing before moving to next
5. Deploy incrementally with feature flags if available

## Post-Implementation

After completing all chunks:

- Monitor usage analytics
- Gather user feedback
- Plan future enhancements from spec's "Nice to Have" section
- Document lessons learned for future feature development
